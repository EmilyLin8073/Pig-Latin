Before you can run the script, you have to create and activate a virtual environment

#### For creating a python virtual environment:

Mac/Unix: use `python -m venv env` command in the project directory

Windows: use `py -m venv env` command in the project directory

#### For activating a python virtual environment:

Mac/Unix: use `source env/bin/activate` command in the project directory

Windows: use `.\env\Scripts\activate` command in the project directory

After virtual environment is activated, use the `python main.py` to run the script

\*Before you run the script, make sure you put the .txt file that you want to convert in the project directory and replace the `file` variable in the main.py with your file name with file extension.

For example `file = 't8.shakespeare.txt'`
