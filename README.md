Before you can run the script, you have to create and activate a virtual environment

#### For creating a python virtual environment:

Mac/Unix: use `python -m venv env` command in the project directory

Windows: use `python -m venv env` command in the project directory

#### For activating a python virtual environment:

Mac/Unix: use `source env/bin/activate` command in the project directory

Windows: use `.\env\Scripts\activate` command in the project directory

After virtual environment is created, use the `python main.py` to run the script
